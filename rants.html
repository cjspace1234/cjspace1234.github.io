    <h2>AI Laptops</h2>
    <h5>02-26-2025</h5>
    
    <p>I don't get the point of ai laptops. Everytime I look at them on the Windows website they praise the ai laptops like they're 10x better than the regular ones, its not a major selling point. I sorta get it, built in ai is cool and they even made a special chip just for ai which I'd imagine would be pretty hard. But I don't think I would ever want a laptop with built in ai. It just adds more to the price and if I want to use ai I would just use chatgpt</p>

    <h2>Laptops</h2>

    <h3>Current Issues</h3>
    <p> I've always wondered why people made the switch from big thick laptops that are indestructible with 40 ports to slim laptops that I need an adapter to plug my mouse into. I know I can just get a Bluetooth mouse (I probably will) but the mouse isn't the problem, the problem is that why can't I get a headphone jack or a video out. I DON'T CARE if my laptop is thick, that just makes it more sturdy. All I want is a regular laptop that is built like Alienware, those things used to be built by hand.</p>
    
    <h3>What I want</h3>
    <p>I want a small portable laptop that is a little bigger than those old polaroid dvd player from the late 2000's. All I wanna do is run most decent steam games and have enough power to make crappy videos. I also want more storage. Another thing with the ports, the usb type-c ones suck, every time I get one they somehow start to bend and then Iâ€™d have to fiddle it until it works. But usb type-a are the best.</p>

    <h2>AAA Batteries</h2>
    <h5>02/25/2025</h5>
    <p>Dear whoever invented these, cool invention. Dear product designers, WHY do you put two AAA in something when a AA battery can be used. Thank you for reading this presentation.
    <br>Edit: I think it has something to do with voltages, Idk</p>
